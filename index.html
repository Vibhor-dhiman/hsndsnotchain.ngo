Child labour means that poverty continues to exist. Eradicating child labour means development and better opportunities for everyone.<br>
                    <br> 
                    Child labour is a serious issue that affects millions of children around the world.
                    It deprives them of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity, and it is harmful to physical and mental development.
                    Children engaged in child labour are often subjected to hazardous conditions and exploitation.
                    The reasons for child labour are complex and varied, including poverty, lack of access to education, and social norms.
                    Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach, including legislative action, community awareness, and support for families to ensure that children can attend school instead of working  
                    It is crucial for governments, organizations, and individuals to work together to combat child labour and to create a world where every child has the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive in a safe environment.
